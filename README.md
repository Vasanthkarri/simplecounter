In this example I learned that we passed the props in constructor and used the state variable to count: 0.
we used onclick button for using increment() and decrement() methods 
when user click the button increase it increase the count by +1
(this.setState{this.state.count + 1})
when user click the button increase it decrease the count by -1
(this.setState{this.state.count - 1})
In these both methods they  used setState to not directly mutate the state variable with help setState it is
used to update set value.
